					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p class="txt">According to Investopedia.com, "Fast Fashion" is the term used to describe
						clothing designs that move quickly from the catwalk to stores to meet new trends, which
						allows mainstream consumers to purchase trendy clothing at an affordable price.
						Our goal is to inform as many people we can about where their clothes come from, how
						they're made, and who makes them. Knowledge is our greatest weapon in the persuit of
						equality.

							<h1>Pollution</h1>
							<p>The fashion industry, worth $2.5 trillion, is only behind the fuel industry in terms
							of pollution. Reducing prices and speeding up manufacturing time ensures environmental
							corners get cut in the interest of benefit. Clean water pollution is a consequence of
							Fast Fashion.</p>

							<h1>Waste</h1>
							<p>The pace at which clothing is manufactured also means that more clothing is
							being thrown away by customers, producing a large volume of textile waste.</p>

						<div class="issue-info">
							<h1>Labour</h1>
							<p>1 in 6 people work in the clothing industry worldwide, of whom only 2% earn
							a living wage. Although 80% are women, children are often forced to work in these
							factories too. The working conditions are harsh and brutal, and accidents often happen
							resulting in many deaths and injuries.</p>

						<div class="issue-info">
							<h1>Microfibres</h1>
							<p>Synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, shed microfibres every time
							the clothes are washed. Each wash on average produce 700,000 microfibres. Which
							are then consumed by marine species, eaten by fish, and then by us. These
							inexpensive clothes bring plastic into our food chain.</p>

						<div class="issue-info">
							<h1>Deforestation</h1>
							<p>Thousands of hectars of endangered rainforests are destroyed every year.
								Animals such as sheep and goats, bred for their wool, are overgrazed in pastures.
								Soil erosion, loss of valuable plant species, food shortages, and famine are some
								of the consequences that come from overgrazing.</p>

	  				<h1>Reuse</h1>
	  				<p>The most effective way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place. Making a new product requires a lot of materials and energy - raw materials must be extracted from the earth, and the product must be fabricated then transported to wherever it will be sold. As a result, reduction and reuse are the most effective ways you can save natural resources, protect the environment and save money.</p>
	  			</div>

	  			<div class="recicle">
	  				<h1>Recycle</h1>
	  				<p>Buy used. You can find everything from clothes to building materials at specialized reuse centers and consignment shops. Often, used items are less expensive and just as good as new.Borrow, rent or share items that are used infrequently, like party decorations, tools or furniture.One person's trash is another person's treasure. Instead of discarding unwanted appliances, tools or clothes, try selling or donating them. </p>
